## About repo

This repository serves as a collection of handy and reusable methods that I find useful in my projects. You might find something useful in here that you can use.

## Organization

The methods in this repository are organized into folders based on the main required package (some also require other packages). Each folder contains related methods that are associated with a specific package(s) or library(s).

## Usage

Feel free to explore the different folders and methods available in this repository. You can browse through the folders to find the specific functionality you need.

These methods are designed to be reusable, saving you time and effort in your projects. Import the desired method into your project, make sure you installed the required packages and then test it out.

## Contributions

This repository is primarily for my personal use. I will try to maintain it to keep it up-to-date and will be adding more methods that I find useful. If you have questions or see something wrong then open an issue.

Happy coding!
